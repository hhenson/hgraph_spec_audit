# Initial port evidence

Status: four reasoned scenarios accepted unanimously; Rust fresh-run specimens implemented.

[Cases](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph_spec/blob/main/compiler/stdlib/cases.json) were written before the Rust implementations. Their rules
are in [node authoring](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph_spec/blob/main/language/docs/design/node-authoring.md). For these traces, no Python/C++
variation needs a ruling. Each of the 23 cells asserts publication or absence
of a tick, not merely a current value.

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Released Python hgraph 0.5.41 | 4/4 scenarios, 23/23 cells |
| Current C++ operators through the Python API | 4/4 scenarios, 23/23 cells |
| Rust replay/node/record graphs | Same four tables; debug and release gates |
| HGL specimens through reference `check` | Accepted |
| HGL specimens through reference `test` | Blocked: process aborts in `NodeCheckpointIdentity` destruction before reporting tests |

The last row is a [toolchain failure](hgl-reference.json), not an output disagreement or a pass.
It reproduced with both available local reference compiler builds. Generated
native code and its loaded runtime may be incompatible; that cause is not yet
proven. The directly exercised Python and C++ operators agree with reasoning.
Do not claim HGL-to-Rust source compilation: these Rust nodes are handwritten.

`nodes.hgl` transcribes the upstream `bit_and<i64>`, `sample<T>` and
`dedup<i64>` bodies. It renames local wrappers, specializes sample to i64 and
colocates the existing native bitwise helper to avoid a package dependency.
Upstream source revision: `73cc53c97c54079e245e538ae61a3709012ba933`.
`cases.hgl` and the Rust test table are generated from the same reasoned JSON.

```sh
python tools/shared_artifacts.py
python -m unittest discover -s compiler/stdlib -p 'test_*.py'
python-hgraph -I compiler/stdlib/replay.py --engine python --output python.json
cpp-hgraph -I compiler/stdlib/replay.py --engine cpp --output cpp.json
hgl check compiler/stdlib/nodes.hgl --part compiler/stdlib/cases.hgl
hgl test compiler/stdlib/nodes.hgl --part compiler/stdlib/cases.hgl
```

Run these commands from this audit checkout. `python-hgraph` and `cpp-hgraph`
denote separately installed interpreters; `hgl` is the C++ compiler from hgraph.
The Rust fixture generator (`tools/stdlib_fixtures.py --check`) and Cargo gates
remain in the private hgl implementation checkout, not this audit package.
Replay refuses the wrong engine and records package and binary hashes. Review
fresh observations before replacing the checked-in evidence.

Native-view tests cover unbound/idle inputs, peered and assembled TSL/TSB,
nested immediate-child `all_valid`, cached invalidation times and scoped REF
retirement and TSD removed-member expiry. Their expectations reuse TS-9/14/25/26 and the accepted fixed
collection corpus; they do not claim new unanimous cross-runtime agreement.
A peered structure is invalidated at its root; removing the final valid child
invalidates an assembly. Retired child storage remains readable during its
retirement cycle, then expires at the next cycle.

[Mutation evidence](mutants.json): all six card mutations were rejected on an
isolated copy. The original workspace remained unchanged.
