# Relocated notes: language/docs/design/node-authoring.md

Source: [specification before separation](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph_spec/blob/766033278bef6e9403cc99c0d8f318ba46a03919/language/docs/design/node-authoring.md).

These excerpts preserve earlier implementation notes and their surrounding
context. They were not revalidated during relocation and do not assert current
support or define language behavior. The current specification owns the rules.
HGL source examples remain in the linked specification revision.

## Excerpt 1

> Status: runtime specimens; [native interface migration](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph_spec/blob/766033278bef6e9403cc99c0d8f318ba46a03919/language/docs/design/native-interfaces.md) in progress.

## Excerpt 2

> Author library behaviour in HGL. Keep its guards, state, scheduling and writes
> there; port native value/view helpers to Rust. Existing HGL is the source of
> truth. Do not introduce a `rust {}` source escape to port C++ bodies.

## Excerpt 3

> The current upstream body, specialized to `i64`, is:

## Excerpt 4

> Its Rust node holds `In<i64>` handles and an `Out<i64>`, implements `Node`, and
> calls `hgl_native::bit_and_i64` directly. `Buildable` constructs handles once.
> `NodeType` declares both inputs active and required valid. The helper receives
> two values; it cannot schedule, publish or retain an input view.

## Excerpt 5

> - **NAT-1:** Select by canonical module/declaration identity, full signature and
>   role. `native const fn hgraph.native.bit_and(i64,i64)->i64` is a value helper;
>   `hgraph.operators.bit_and` is a temporal operator. Neither substitutes for
>   the other. Resolve candidates in the checker, retain the selection in IR.
> - **NAT-2:** Generate the implementation interface from the HGL contract. C++
>   uses a checked `bind<T>()` adapter; Rust implements a generated trait. Keep
>   implementations in native source and dependencies in its normal library build.
>   Select the provider once, without a separately authored function-symbol map.
>   Missing, ambiguous or incompatible providers are compile errors.
> - **NAT-3:** Value helpers receive admitted payloads. Input-view helpers borrow
>   the current input, including its local binding state. The borrow ends with
>   the call; no copying collections, retaining views or resolving output names
>   per tick. `signal` queries must also work before validity.
> - **NAT-4:** A temporal implementation owns activation, guards, state, lifecycle
>   and writes. A helper call adds no node and emits no tick on its own. Keep
>   equal ordinary ticks; suppress equal REF designations under TS-16.
> - **NAT-5:** HGL `state` is semantic history, requiring checkpoint restoration;
>   `cache` must be reconstructible. A plain Rust field proves fresh-run behaviour
>   only. Fallible helpers will return a typed `Result`, translated at the node
>   boundary; catching panics is not the native error contract.
> - **NAT-6:** Validate a shaped handle at construction. Metadata helpers inspect
>   the input view for peered and assembled TSL/TSB, TSD and REF. Do not infer
>   input time or validity by inspecting only its peer. Preserve the accepted
>   removal, invalidation, rebinding and child-scope rules.
> - **NAT-7:** Check capability requirements for HGL and native functions alike.
>   Calls silently add the callee's requirements to the caller, transitively and
>   without duplicates. `inject out` refers to the declared temporal result. Value functions may use
>   admitted context services without acquiring a node. Selected HGL implementation parts declare
>   target requests and lifecycle hooks; the shared declaration owns the signature. See the
>   [capability contract](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph_spec/blob/766033278bef6e9403cc99c0d8f318ba46a03919/language/docs/design/native-interfaces.md#implementation-parts-and-injectables).

## Excerpt 6

> | HGL helper | Rust call | Projection |
> |---|---|---|
> | `hgraph.native.bit_and(i64,i64)->i64` | `hgl_native::bit_and_i64(lhs, rhs)` | Current values; no borrowed result |
> | `hgraph.native.valid(signal)->bool` | `InputView::valid` | Immutable live input, evaluation only |
> | `hgraph.native.all_valid(signal)->bool` | `InputView::all_valid` | Immediate-child validity, not recursive leaf completeness |
> | `hgraph.native.modified(signal)->bool` | `InputView::modified` | Current cycle and input-local state |
> | `hgraph.native.last_modified(signal)->datetime` | `InputView::last_modified` | Engine time available; datetime payload mapping pending |

## Excerpt 7

> A generated call creates `InputView::new(ctx.store(), input, ctx.evaluation_time())`
> for that call only. An assembled input need not have a peer output. Fixed
> projections are resolved during construction; dynamic member views are borrowed
> from current membership, never cached past removal or child teardown.

## Excerpt 8

> The future mapping catalogue must test wrong signatures, forbidden phases,
> borrowed-result escape, ambiguous candidates and missing target capabilities.
> These are compiler acceptance scenarios, not checks implemented by this probe.
> The ordinary Rust compiler checks the concrete helper calls already present.

## Excerpt 9

> | Layer | Present | Work needed |
> |---|---|---|
> | Node recipe | `Node`, `Ctx`, `Buildable`; construction-time port lookup | Emit the recipe from checked bodies; ordered handlers and early returns |
> | Wiring | Recursive descriptions, peered/assembled ports, scoped children | Preserve resolved contracts and specializations into descriptions |
> | Selection | Registry of concrete `NodeType`s | Canonical identities, overloads, constraints, capabilities; registry is not the HGL resolver |
> | Native helpers | This probe's value calls and borrowed metadata | Validated target catalogue and module import integration |
> | State/lifecycle | Fields, start/eval/stop, scheduling, child teardown | Recordable state and scheduler recovery; owned native resource/error contracts |
> | Types | bool/i64/f64, fixed TSL/TSB, i64-keyed TSD, REF | Nominal schema identity, other keys/scalars, dynamic lists, sets, windows, owned values |

## Excerpt 10

> The compiler remains Lexer → Parser → Checker → Emitter. The checker owns
> normalization, validity analysis, candidate and target selection. The emitter
> receives resolved calls, handler guards, state layouts and concrete bindings;
> it must not recreate overload resolution or inspect C++ bodies.

## Excerpt 11

> The [const/debug graph](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph_spec/blob/766033278bef6e9403cc99c0d8f318ba46a03919/language/examples/const-debug.hgl) is the first complete
> Rust compiler slice. Both nodes, their metadata and graph construction are
> generated from the upstream-tested HGL. Only integer printing is a handwritten
> native implementation. The earlier standard-library specimens below remain
> handwritten and do not imply compiler support for their bodies.

## Excerpt 12

> `hgl-native` provides `bit_and_i64` and four borrowed endpoint queries.
> `hgl-stdlib` contains hand-written lowering specimens for `bit_and<i64>`,
> `sample<i64>` (an i64 signal input) and `dedup<i64>`. These are executable
> fresh-run ports, not compiler-generated implementations or replacement core
> registrations. `dedup` recovery remains blocked by NAT-5.

## Excerpt 13

> The [cases](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph_spec/blob/766033278bef6e9403cc99c0d8f318ba46a03919/compiler/stdlib/cases.json) give reasoning before execution. Expected output
> cells mean **ticks**, not held values; `null` means no tick. The replay compares
> released Python operators, current C++ operators and the HGL C++ projection.
> Borrowed-view tests additionally reuse accepted recursive runtime rules;
> existing [variations](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph_spec_audit/blob/main/runtime/validation/fixed/README.md) still apply.

## Excerpt 14

> Upstream's catalogue at `73cc53c97c54079e245e538ae61a3709012ba933` contains 210
> core identities: 26 implemented, 44 partial domains, 6 native providers and
> 134 blocked **in upstream HGL**, not in Rust.

## Excerpt 15

> 1. Reuse accepted HGL module parts and their tests. Port scalar helpers and
>    default/explicit `when`, passive inputs, `inject out`, state and lifecycle.
> 2. Implement checked Rust target mappings. Exercise scalar values, borrowed
>    recursive views and a throwing helper before claiming a stable binding ABI.
> 3. Port collection nodes against TSD/REF/nested-graph traces, including removed
>    members and rebinding. Add typed views without flattening assemblies.
> 4. Add owned scalar/container types, sets/windows and recovery capabilities;
>    then domain providers and higher-order operators. Each catalogue entry names
>    its supported domain, evidence and blocker; never mark a family complete
>    from one specialization.

## Excerpt 16

> Upstream references: `language/stdlib/hgl/hgraph/{operators,stream,native}.hgl`,
> `language/stdlib/catalogue/README.md`, `language/docs/design/native-interface.md`
> and ADR 0008, “Language contracts and target mappings”. ADR 0014 settles shared native interfaces and source-owned implementations;
> collection-view spelling and the full migration remain tracked separately.
